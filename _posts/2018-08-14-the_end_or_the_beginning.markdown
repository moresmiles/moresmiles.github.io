As I wind down my journey through Learn.co, I am amazed at the person that has come out on the other side.

Besides the fact, that before I began the program I would not have been able to tell you what a command line was or even name three coding languages, and now I live in the terminal and speak various  languages. (I am very happy about that, don't get me wrong!)

But, Learn.co taught me so much more. 

* I learned discipline, and gained the ability to sit and concentrate for long periods of time.

* I experienced (often) what psychologists call "flow", from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)):

> In positive psychology, flow, also known colloquially as being in the zone, is the mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in what one does, and a resulting loss in one's sense of space and time.

* I learned how to learn with others, and the power of collaboration.

* I learned how to be part of a passionate growth oriented community.

* I learned how to strenghten myself at times when I felt lost/frustrated/broken/like a coding imposter.

* I learned that the key to success to anything in life is to be constantly learning.

I would like to thank all the instructors and fellow students for all there help and support throughout this journey. I hope that I can bring some of the key lessons that I learned in Learn.co to a company soon, and most importantly to keep on learning!
