As with every portfolio project the first hurdle is always coming up with an idea for a project. I knew that I wanted to create a CRUD application, and I also knew that i didnt want it to involve blog posts and authors or a todo list. 

As I sat at my desk pondering this question, the delicious beer in my hand provided me with the answer.

Taste and See is a CRUD app that lets you: (you guessed it) **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, and **D**elete beers.

## The Process

### Authentication

Since this was going to be a CRUD app that is designed to have many users, the app would require user authentication. Throughout the React/Redux curriculum, user authentication was not covered, and so began some research.

Enter "Knock" 

From the README:

`Knock is an authentication solution for Rails API-only application based on JSON Web Tokens.`

Knock is very lightweight and stateless, and was rather easy to get up and running.

### Rails API

Working with Rails as just an API, was a sad experience for me, as almost all of the Rails MAGIC, is not really put to use, but I digress...

After creating a Users resource, all I needed was a Beers resource, for all the Beer CRUD actions.

### React & Redux

As this was my first project from scratch using react, we were encouraged to use the `create-react-app`. 

The more I code in React the more I appreciate its usefulness. I really feel like I am starting to get a good hold on React and all its React'ness. The same goes for Redux.


### In Conclusion for now

As I am writing this after a long session of coding,  I am quite exhausted. For now, I very much wish to submit the project,  a more thorough blog post to follow on the ins and outs of this project.
